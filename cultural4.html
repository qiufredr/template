			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>After his incident with the bullies at an early age, the movie shows another scene where Forrest is being chased once again by bullies. This time Forrest is in high school and he is being chased by a pickup truck. Once again Forrest outruns the bullies and ends up running through a football field where the coaches and football players see Forrest’s running talent. This is another example of how Forrest overcame his obstacles. Forrest’s social troubles remain throughout the rest of the movie. 
Bullying is a serious topic, and in most cases, it can be solved very easily without violence such as diplomacy, or physically avoiding it. In the movie Forrest Gump, Forrest almost embraces it. He is bullied for being stupid, and for being a cripple, but eventually overcomes it. He says “Stupid is what stupid does”. Forrest knows he is stupid, but doesn’t let that stop him from accomplishing his dreams. He eventually becomes a famous college football player, receives a Medal of Honor, etc. He never let his problems and issues control him and that allowed him to be successful. 
Forrest overcame all of his greatest obstacles as a child, and he was motivated by bullying. He stayed with a positive attitude and did everything with his best effort. Because of the bullying, Forrest was encouraged to learn to read, unlocked his potential for running, eventually save the lives of his platoon during the Vietnam War despite higher orders, and even marry the love of his life.
