			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Bullying is something that needs to be stopped, and is everywhere. It’s a kind of behavior that can be easily changed with the right minds. Somewhere somehow, in every bully’s head, there is always a reason and there is always a solution to the bullying they put others through. Sometimes these ideas can be changed but often not. 
Self-confidence is the key to solving many things including bullying. With the right attitude and determination, one can overcome anything. I propose to set up a program to teach kids in school about bullying, or to have parents talk to their children about it at least once. This kind of program would not prevent bullying or induce bullying, but instead as a guideline to approaching one that is a victim of bullying. In most bullying cases, the bullying persists because it is not brought to the authorities. For any reason that it’s not, it is up to the victim to deal with the behavior. The proposal is to teach kids and teenagers how to protect themselves from bullying; both physically and mentally. There are many different situations, but many of them can be solved with a change of mindset. Usually, bully victims do not like to talk about their situation because they are embarrassed about it, depressed, or feel bad about it. From personal experience, I know many people that felt that way. The most common thing is to ignore it, but in reality that never solves the problem. A psychologist would probably tell a victim to stay who they are and accept what is going on, and to have higher authority to step in, which is very important. However, in many cases that does not happen, and many people need an alternative solution.
The program would have a flexible guideline, because each case of bullying is different, whether it be online, in person, with one person, or with a group of people. For example in a scenario with a group of aggressive bullies, the mentality is to avoid them without giving them any attention. A positive attitude will always accept constructive criticism. The program would educate bully victims or even bullies how to act in the event of something happening. Of course higher authorities should be contacted, but in many events that is not possible; places like cyber bullying and verbal harassment.
