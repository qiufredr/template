			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>One cultural artifact that seemed to have a close link to these issues is the movie Forrest Gump (1994). It’s a classic movie that has won 44 awards including “Academy Award for best picture” and Academy awards for best director, actor, and adapted screenplay, as well as being nominated for countless other awards. This movie is about a man’s life, Forrest Gump, and how he grows up through various historic events. This movie also contains a large portion of symbolism, which ties with bullying and self-confidence. 
The movie begins where Forrest is a child, and receives leg braces to support his arching back. We learn that Forrest has a speech impediment and he has a low IQ. Later in this scene, he walks with his childhood friend Jenny, and encounters a group of bullies, chasing Forrest away knowing he cannot run in his leg braces. Once Forrest begins running, he realizes that he is much faster than the other kids whom were riding bicycles. This scene represents how one person was bullied, and overcame it with persistence. He broke through his leg braces, representing freedom and showing his true talent of running.
