			<p>The way information is communicated between healthcare professionals is often through form; either in physical paper by mail or by fax, to computer generated forms, emails, and database. In clinical practice, laboratory scientists receive requests from physicians or from a company to analyze and record data from very specific things, for very specific reasons.  In the fast paced health care industry today, clinical labs have to work extremely efficiently and one of the largest bottlenecks of this is communication. Because of the role of clinical labs, laboratory scientists must work efficiently and accurately. In many situations, physicians need information quickly to help a patient, or to diagnose someone’s condition.
