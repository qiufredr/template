			<p>From a personal interview with a student at Michigan State University working in a paid laboratory internship, B. Jake, I conclude that laboratory technicians keep data written by hand; most things are written in a lab notebook including data, calculations, and observations. Jake said that, “the tests I do are awfully long sometimes and it takes a long time just to set up the lab and prepare for the procedures.” He also said that “when we conduct labs, we usually stick with scientific method, and usually we prepare a lot of tables and graphs. We want to know what we are looking before we even start.” It seems that most of this lab work is written and calculated by hand. Graphs and charts are very important for analyzing data and comparing it. When asked “Do you enter in data onto an electronic record?” Jake responded: “no.” From this, it seems as though not all institutions/ healthcare systems have adhered to an EHR medical record yet. 


<p>In Linda Mccown’s dissertation for clinical instructors, she describes the information that clinical instructors should be teaching. She goes to experienced clinical laboratory technicians and interviews them about their experiences in their profession and education. From that, she shows the social behavior, relationship between coworkers, interns, students, etc. She also writes about the limitations of laboratory science, coinciding with data collection and technology. The dissertation is extremely lengthy and detailed; containing lots of information and experience that could be very essential to a laboratory intern or a student. Some of these experiences teach about specific instances that include how to communicate in the workplace, the pace at which new procedures or technologies emerge, and things pertaining to teaching. Mccown also explains, that a laboratory technician cannot be fully trained just by formal education; “The professionals at such hospital sites are usually involved with teaching the student both the cognitive background knowledge as well as the clinical rotations often simultaneously.” The cognitive background knowledge is something that can’t be learned in “clinical rotations” which is a “period of time spent in a medical department learning the job of a professional, incorporating knowledge and skills learned in campus courses and student laboratories and learning professional behaviors and attitudes.”(Mccown) Mccown’s dissertation encircles the fact that knowledge and experience is the key to a successful laboratory scientist. She explains that some things can’t just be learned in a classroom, and by interviewing multiple experienced scientists and professors, she learns how much experience matters in the field.  


<p>Nader Rifai wrote a special report about the growth of laboratory medicine; his report named “Advancing Laboratory Medicine through Innovation: A Tale of Six Inventors.” Within this report, there are experiences of successful inventors that have greatly contributed in this field with their work. He discusses the importance of technology and innovation in laboratory science. The first scientist, Eleftherios Diamandis, explained how his knowledge working at a small biotech company was invaluable not only in the scientific field, but also socially. He was able to approach companies with his research instead of the opposite; a free approach that helps collaboration on multiple companies. Another scientist was Dennis Lo, whom had been able to accomplish his goals in DNA research because of the emerging technology. Because of “real-time quantitative PCR”, Dennis had been able to excel in his DNA research. These stories that Rifai had collected are important to laboratory scientists; they are leaders and role models that show just how important laboratory medicine is.

<p>Another piece of writing is “The Role of Laboratory Medicine in Accountable Care Organization”, a document written by Joe Miles, and Ronald Weiss. This paper is a very recent document showing the current state of Laboratory Science. Because of the 2 acts passed by the US government in 2009 and 2010, there has been a large growth in need for laboratory scientists; they call it a “once in a generation opportunity.” Miles explains that, “Pathology and laboratory medicine play pivotal roles in the creation and use of meaningful clinical information, impacting the diagnosis and treatment of patients as well as test utilization and cost of care. The practice of medicine is not easy. The correct diagnosis and course of treatment is not always clear. Therefore, with every episode of care the resources expend ensuring a timely and accurate diagnosis may be the most important because they influence all other decisions thereafter in the delivery of care. The effective use of resources to perform the right test at the right time and as close to the patient as possible is essential to the achievement of quality patient outcomes.” He continues to then talk about how laboratories are integrated to hospitals and the effects of EHR systems on them. Because the traditional communication before the series of acts had limited success, Miles believes that the EHR and improved communication technologies will present information better, bettering relationships between labs and practitioners; improving the overall delivery and efficiency of healthcare. He states that it is extremely critical that “laboratory directors become high-level messengers and articulate the value of their laboratory services and the pivotal role of the laboratory in ensuring that an accurate diagnosis is established early.” Integration between healthcare parties is encouraged and because of recent events, it is much more prevalent.
