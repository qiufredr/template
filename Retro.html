        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>Throughout the semester, WRA 110 has been a wild trip. This class, about Writing: Science and Technology can seem deceivingly easy. It is in fact not, and requires lot of work and dedication. From my experience throughout the semester, I can say that this course is just touching the tip of the iceberg. As a freshman, this is an introductory class about writing, and it only gets tougher from here. This class not only taught me about writing, but it taught me a lot of other things as well, from things like procrastination, writing lengthy papers, working with other people, and comprehending what a college classes compose of. This class was mostly composed of making a blog, alongside with learning how to write in HTML, and doing several writing projects.</p>
        
        <h2>Lived Experiences</h2>
        <p>Our first project was the lived experiences project. In my own project, I chose to write about the effects of computers on the subject of my major. The purpose of the project was to identify a specific career track and learn about it; discover and explore what lies in your major and if that career path is right for you. That project also helped me understand the importance of technology; not only in life, but also in my major. I think overall, I did pretty well on this project. I didn’t spend as much time as I could have on brainstorming, but since most of it was personal experience and objective, it was simple to write about with my few solid points. Looking over my paper again, I think I could improve several things. I’ve never really excelled at writing, so my word choices were sometimes poor, if not terrible. I think a good way to improve my writing for this paper specifically is to find a thesaurus and replace a lot of the pronouns and boring words in it. Another way I could improve on this paper is to re-organize each paragraph. I think the overall outline is well set up, but one thing I didn’t do while writing my lived experience project, is pay attention to my organization. In some of the paragraphs, the order doesn’t really make sense, and often times I don’t explain my examples or anecdotes. Another major flaw I spotted while reviewing the paper entirely, is that I don’t have a set audience, and the tone of the paper is very neutral. The purpose of my project was to explain my life experiences to incoming college students, but I may have strayed away from that tone throughout my essay. For the most part, I think I nailed my topic and I stayed on point, but there is always room for improvement. </p>
        
        <h2>Cultural analysis</h2>
        <p>The next project from the class was the cultural analysis proposal. This was a proposal to investigate a specific social issue and relate to it using an artifact of pop culture. I specifically used a movie to relate to my social issue. Using the movie Forrest Gump, I chose to relate to bullying and techniques to deal with and prevent bullying. This project was difficult in that the artifact may not be entirely related to the specific social issue, and it is difficult to write an entire essay about it. Along with the paper, I also learned about organizing my information, how to write an executive summary, how to include a proposal into my essay, and other things. For my cultural analysis project, I started late. I was sick and didn’t go to class the day it was assigned, and the project spanned over spring break. Instead of being a diligent student, I didn’t have much motivation to even brainstorm for the project until mid-spring break. I didn’t really have anything substantial and I resulted to finding the easiest option to write about for my project. I ended up writing the paper under a lot of stress, not only from time (due soon), but I also had a lot of tests to study for in my other classes. If I were to change the way I handled this project, I would have started it a lot earlier, and I would have tried to finish the entire project during spring break. I opted to stay at home for spring break, so I had lots of time to work on it, but I chose not to which is my biggest regret. Upon re-reading my paper, I noticed that I repeated a lot of my points. I think I used the wrong artifact to use for my topic, since the movie had so little to do with my topic. Forrest Gump only touches the iceberg about bullying, and doesn’t really expand upon it for the rest of the movie. I chose to use the movie Forrest Gump because it seemed like an easy and good idea at the time; the prevalence of bullying seemed to stand out to me, because the movie was so well done. While I was writing the paper, I felt like I didn’t have enough ideas to fill the word requirement, and I should have just restarted with a different topic or artifact. If I were to re-do this entire paper, I would. </p>
        
        <h2>Formal Research</h2>
        <p>The Formal research project was extremely helpful. Because the report was a formal report, required a lot of research, and required around 3000 words, this project was difficult and helped me understand how to write an actual formal research paper, which I assume I will have to do for many other classes throughout college. For this project, I used the discipline of laboratory medicine, and the importance of communication and technology in it. It was especially hard to write about this, because of the limiting topic, but I learned a lot of things in the process. It was required to do things such as finding scholarly articles, interviewing people, and analyzing multiple sources. It helped me learn not only how to read these lengthy articles and dissect them, but I learned how to approach someone for an interview and talk ask about various things. The fact is, I ended up not reading all of the articles I found. A lot of these articles that I found were extremely long, and I reading parts of it, and using little pieces from it. A lot of other sources ended up not being used at all because I had to pay money to read them. I read over this, and it truly was a pretty bad research paper. I didn’t use nearly as many facts and sources as I should have, and that’s the reason my paper really just lacked meaningful content. This was my first research paper, and now I realize that I truly need to research to be able to write something meaningful. A lot of details are left unanswered in my formal report that could easily be answered if I did some more research. Another big flaw is that throughout the project, I didn’t know who the audience was, and I didn’t have a very stable topic. I still don’t really know who the audience really is. I just assumed that there wasn’t really an audience, and that I was just trying to present facts for someone to run into and use somehow. </p>
        
        <h2>Remix</h2>
        <p>The most fun project of these is the Remix Project. This was a group project in which we had to take an old project and transform it into a documentary. Doing this, I had to be able to dissect someone’s paper and reach a level of understanding with other group members. This group project also taught me how to work in groups, and also how to work under the stress of time. Because we had an unexpected amount of time used to brainstorm, a lot of the video work and editing was done in a few sittings. This group project was very fun and I think our group did very well on it. Our topic was good, and our organization and execution was good as well. I feel like this project was one of the most organized group projects I have ever done. Individually, we all worked very hard and stayed on task. I feel like I did a lot of the work, but there was no other choice. If I had split my work with my group, it wouldn’t have been done as quickly as we had it done. If I could improve this project, I would have either used a better editing software than Microsoft movie maker, and I would have started brainstorming earlier. </p>
        
        <h2>Retrospective</h2>
        <p>Finally, the last project is the retrospective project, which is this project. This project is mainly two parts, and both help sum up the course very well. The first part of the project was a class activity, and I tried to participate by sharing my ideas, but the organization was very sparse, and I never talked to the web-team. I haven’t seen the final product, and I think it really helps the audience for the project more than it helped my own literature education. The second part of the project (this) was very enlightening, and I found it one of the most meaningful projects of the semester. If this report wasn’t here, I would have never picked up my old writing projects again, and I wouldn’t know what I was doing wrong every time. Now that I’ve reviewed over my past literature, I feel like I understand my own writing style a little more, as well as how to correct myself.</p>
