			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>This proposal is made to achieve two things. To raise bullying awareness, and to prepare people in the case of bullying. Bullying exists in many age groups, but the most vulnerable times are in childhood and teenage years, which should be the target audience for the program. Just like in Forrest Gump, people should take no sign to bullying or harassment. Hopefully the program will make people feel safer, better, and most importantly, more confident about their lives and aspirations. 
At the end of the movie Forrest Gump, Forrest is a successful accomplished man that seems to have the purest look on life. This man who was once made fun of for speak impediment, cripple, low IQ, and illiterate, moved on in his life to accomplish many things. In real life, people could be like this too. Many people suffer from bullying each day, and people hide it because of fear and humiliation. Like Forest, with the right attitude, anyone can push through obstacles and succeed. Forrest says “Stupid is what stupid does”, when people throughout the movie call him stupid. This is a symbol of ignorance where people think Forrest is stupid because he has a low IQ, but in reality, he knows much more and is much wiser than the people that bully him.
