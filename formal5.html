			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
			<p>Generally, it is the Lab scientist�s responsibility to research the topic beforehand, be able to prepare, operate precisely, record data, perform physical laboratory functions, etc. It is the scientist�s responsibility to dissect, and analyze samples using specific tests to be able to record the desired data, often doing a variety of diagnosis tests, and procedures. Along with analyzing the data, the findings must take account medical records, previous conditions, etc. When doing research, lab scientists have to use intuition and ambitious, asking and answering their own questions. The results are often discussed with other laboratory scientists and physicians. Once the data is thoroughly analyzed, and all questions are answered, it is sent to be used elsewhere. For example, in order for a physician to know whether or not to do cardiovascular surgery, a blood test is requested to the lab. �Laboratory data are involved in 70% of the critical decisions (Mccown).� Once requested by a physician, there are specific pieces of critical data usually recorded; i.e. allergy, glucose level, blood type, nutrient levels, etc. Once the vital pieces of data are collected, the laboratory scientist analyzes the data along with previous medical record, inspecting any changes and abnormalities. The data is then either put in a database or sent directly back to the physician to see. 
<p>More and more technology is used in the lab. Modern laboratories are much more capable of obtaining and analyzing data with the help of technology. Because clinical laboratory research is a growing field, the HITECH act and ACA were passed and allowed scientists to do more things. Modern medical research differs from laboratory medicine in that it does not always work with hospitals and physicians. Some medical lab research is conducted for military, forensics, and else for animals; i.e. Lockheed martin, Navy, etc. Laboratory science is based on using some very cryptic tools, as well as advanced technology. Things like pipets, flasks, petri dishes, beakers, centrifuges, chromatography machines, microscopes, etc. have been used to analyze things like blood and body fluids. Newer advanced laboratories are now equipped with things to research DNA technology, cancer research, and drug testing equipment. This discipline requires a variety of skills, one which is vital. To be able to use and accurately read laboratory equipment i.e. technology. Laboratories now are equipped with more high tech equipment (from the HITECH act). Scientists in this field can have better and more thorough data, as well as having a more efficient way to record and analyze it. 

<p>The HITECH Act (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health act) was passed in 2009 that has direct influence on healthcare communication. The act is specifically targeted toward hospitals, laboratories, and public health care agencies to improve the quality and speed of communication. It is an act to reform the EHR (Electronic Health Record), which is a more modern and interconnected system of health care communication. Through EHR, data and research can be recorded and used by hospitals and laboratories to improve healthcare overall. </p>
