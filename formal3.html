			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>Laboratory Medicine is very important in the medical field. The group of physicians, scientists and nurses that work together is a group of “allied health professionals” or health care professionals; “only 40 percent of health care professionals are doctors and nurses” (Mccown). The rest are professionals in the MLS or Medical laboratory science. The reason it is considered “allied” is because all professions are vital to each other’s success. Specifically, laboratory science is very important. Laboratory scientists aid physicians and doctors for decisions on many critical procedures. This is why communication in this field is vital; because it is rarely face to face communication from hospital to laboratory, it is often imperative to analyze and record information in the best way possible. 

<p>Within Medical laboratory science, there are many disciplines that branch from it; such as clinical pathology, anatomic pathology, genetics, hematology, and reproductive biology. Each refers to a different area of study and practice, but all pertain to healthcare and laboratory research. Laboratories often contain a variety of professionals, but the most common name for a laboratory scientist is a certified MLS. Other professionals in a laboratory that are vital to the healthcare process could be a pathologist, clinical biologist, or a laboratory assistant. 

<p>The both clinical pathology and anatomical pathology are the main types of laboratory medicine discipline.  “Pathology involves examining the cause of illness, how it develops, the effect of the illness on cells and the outcome of the illness.” (Mandal) Both are studies of diseases; how it works and develops, what they are, what they can do, etc. Laboratory research in the medical field branches off into many fields, but the most widespread research are on diseases like cancers, malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, etc. Clinical pathology is laboratory study on specifically body fluids; blood, lymph, excretion, etc. Through body fluids, there are many diseases that can be diagnosed. That is why, within clinical pathology, there are other studies such as chemical pathology, immunology (allergies, immune system disorders), and hematology (blood diseases). Anatomic pathology is different; instead of studying just blood and body fluids, the scientist takes into account everything else in the body. This is often performed in a lab as an autopsy or biopsy, often with diseases that are larger. In both cases, cells are broken down, tested with multiple tests, and analyzed to either diagnose, or to study diseases. Research is usually eventually published or shared among other scientists, but because researching is usually privatized, sometimes information isn’t communicated.
