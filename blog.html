                <h1>lived experiences project- Video Response</h1>
                <p>I believe the purpose of the video is to inform, educate, and warn people about suicide, love, and sexuality.
                Through the explaination of the suicide of his uncle, the viewers develop a feeling of sadness and sympathy.
                Not everyone knows how it is to lose a loved one, but in this case, we can see how harsh and unforgiving it is on this young man.
                Suicide is a very harsh act. The narrator made it apparent that his uncle commited suicide soley on the basis of him not being accepted by society; specifically by angelicalists.
                The narrator also connects this story of his uncle with his own personal life.
                He talks about his own life, how he fell in love with his best friend while in college, and that he is also gay, like his uncle.
                That is crucial in grabbing the viewer, because now the viewers begin to associate his story with the narrator himself, and then to other people as well.
                Much hate against gays exist today, and this video shows that love is love, and if someone is really in love with someone of the same gender,they should not be exiled for it.
                He showed how he lost a close loved one, just because they werent accepted and was bullied away.
                Through the grieving and letter to his uncle, we see how large of an impact had on the narrator, and how it could affect anyone today. 
                He shows the point that no one should be bullied to the point of suicide, especially not over sexuality.
                The structure of his message began with a written letter to introduce the sensitive topic, followed by a poem that related to the topic to set the attitude, as well as show his viewpoint.
                He then goes on to use personal references to tell a story. Through his experience, we see how he feels, and how his life was affected.
                </p>
                <p>This video's structure is very good because it has a good introduction to a very sensitive topic. 
                His body structure is also very good, he explained the connection to his uncle, and used his own experiences to express his views.
                The topic of the video itself is thought about today, and something that is not completely accepted yet.
                The video's topic make the viewer even more engaged, and maybe even relates more to certain people's lives.
