        <h5>Blog Entry 1</h1>
                
                <p>I believe the purpose of the video is to inform, educate, and warn people about suicide, love, and sexuality.
                Through the explaination of the suicide of his uncle, the viewers develop a feeling of sadness and sympathy.
                Not everyone knows how it is to lose a loved one, but in this case, we can see how harsh and unforgiving it is on this young man.
                Suicide is a very harsh act. The narrator made it apparent that his uncle commited suicide soley on the basis of him not being accepted by society; specifically by angelicalists.
                The narrator also connects this story of his uncle with his own personal life.
                He talks about his own life, how he fell in love with his best friend while in college, and that he is also gay, like his uncle.
                That is crucial in grabbing the viewer, because now the viewers begin to associate his story with the narrator himself, and then to other people as well.
                Much hate against gays exist today, and this video shows that love is love, and if someone is really in love with someone of the same gender,they should not be exiled for it.
                He showed how he lost a close loved one, just because they werent accepted and was bullied away.
                Through the grieving and letter to his uncle, we see how large of an impact had on the narrator, and how it could affect anyone today. 
                He shows the point that no one should be bullied to the point of suicide, especially not over sexuality.
                The structure of his message began with a written letter to introduce the sensitive topic, followed by a poem that related to the topic to set the attitude, as well as show his viewpoint.
                He then goes on to use personal references to tell a story. Through his experience, we see how he feels, and how his life was affected.
                </p>
                <p>This video's structure is very good because it has a good introduction to a very sensitive topic. 
                His body structure is also very good, he explained the connection to his uncle, and used his own experiences to express his views.
                The topic of the video itself is thought about today, and something that is not completely accepted yet.
                The video's topic make the viewer even more engaged, and maybe even relates more to certain people's lives.

        <h5>Blog Entry 2</h1>
                
                <p>Class was cancelled today, so I didn't do much.
                It's the second day of class because of the recent snow days so there isn't much to do, especially because I havent gotten all of my textbooks yet.
                I have no idea what is waiting for me for this semester, but I feel like it will be an interesting experience. 
                I've never had a hybrid class before, nor a class that combines writing with technology.
                </p>
                
        <h5>Blog Entry 3</h1>
                
                <p>Today, our cultural analysis draft was due during class. 
                I thought it was actually due DURING class, but it was just due online, the day of. 
                Since I didn't really know that we had to submit it online, I rushed through my rough draft after class to turn it in as soon as I could.
                
                The video was about the unhealthy affects of technology on people, and especially teenagers, and middle aged adults.
                Because of the recent increasing development of technology like computers, phones, and video games, I think people are more likely to stray from reality.
                We always see video games take over peoples' lives, and now we begin to see how social culture from technology does too.
                The video primarily focused on video gamers, and my friends and I are considered some of the many in that category. 
                Gamers are portrayed as introverts that destroy their lives and "waste" it away sitting infront of a monitor, and I completely agree with that.
                If i had the motivation, I would get off my computer and I'd get out and do things, but often times I find that my computer is powerfully addicting, and this video shows me that I'm not alone.
                As things change and evolve, new problems arise. Just as the evolution of technology has changed the lives of these many individuals.

        <h5>Blog Entry 4</h1>
        
                <p>The chrysler ad was very touching to me. A lot of us Michigan residents are big detroit fans, eminem fans, big 3 motor company fans, and this commercial makes me feel like I'm part of something.
                The commercial makes me feel proud of where I live. Detroit has "been to hell and back", it had its ups and downs, and now a lot of it has become famously dangerous for its ghettos and gangs, but this commercial makes me feel like it isn't there.
                The chrystler 200 is "made it detroi" and even better, it had eminem driving it with his badass song in the background. I think it gives not only detroit, but also Michigan a certain character or image for the rest of the world to see and feel.
                I've seen this commercial many times, and it's always very catching to me, especially since you don't see commercials on national TV advertising something that is "made in detroit"
