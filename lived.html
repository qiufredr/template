When you walk out of the house, what do you bring with you? Most people today would bring at least a cell phone, if not a smart phone, tablet, or a laptop. Computers are more prevalent nowadays than it has ever been before, and because of that, so is networking.
	The computer has been a big factor in my career. I was raised with a computer in my house, and my mother is a developer at Ford Motor Co. Throughout my life, I’ve always been interested in computers, and how they work. Now, computers are associated with networking. Things like PC’s make it easy to record information, share information, calculate various things humans can’t do, and even analyze certain types of data. 
Ever since I was a child, my whole family has been interested in computers and tech. For one thing, it was practical, but it’s also pretty cool. I remember distinctly the first time my dad recorded me singing “Abc” on his PC to the first time my dad taught me how to type and put CD’s in the computer. For me, I got my very own laptop PC when I was 13. It was a gateway; 2GB RAM, 1.4 GHz AMD processor, and AMD GPU. Within a few years of having my laptop, the hard drive failed. That was the first time I took apart a computer and truly looked at the internals. What I saw piqued my interest. Inside the computer existed a living, breathing organism. It had a brain, a circulatory system, a digestive system, everything. Just from opening my laptop I could see just where every bit of noise came from. The hard drive made a whirring, clicking sound, the fan made the constant blowing of air. I remember particularly the processor. On the motherboard existed an open space, where a chip about 2x2 cm with a sticker; “AMD Athlon”. I thought about just how small this chip was, and later after some googling, I discovered how much this tiny chip actually did. Since then, I learned to appreciate computers and how they worked. Behind computers, hours and hours upon sweat and blood has been put into making the operating system, all of the adjacent programs, and all of the hardware that can do seemingly impossible things, such as send information through airspace (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), as well has hold trillions of bytes of information in just a pen drive that’s smaller and thinner than your eraser. Even behind that, lies even more jaw dropping technology feats.
Computers have been a large part of many people’s lives, many people often make a living sitting in front of a computer. This is one of the reasons why I choose to pursue a career with computers. At Michigan State University, I’m currently studying biology laboratory science, but I want to eventually study bioinformatics. The reason why I want to study bioinformatics is because I love computers and I’m interested in the languages and components with them, and I also love biology. With those two interests combined, I hope to further research in both technology and biology.
Because of the recent developments in computer technology, and networking technology, it is just as easy to store data, as well to find it. Especially in a laboratory, organization of data is 99% of the work. Whether it be from recording data to a database, or researching on the internet database, to using vital software tools, computers and networking are the most vital to medical and biological research in this modern age. Computers are connected together by the internet; “a global system of interconnected computer networks.” You may not know it, but billions upon billions of bytes of data are constantly flowing around us, either in the form of wireless data, or by physical cable lines. Every day, we find new uses for networking, whether it come from social media, entertainment, or for more practical things like stocks, trade, and research. In the medical field, as well as many others, technology and networking are constantly growing outward with new databases, new algorithms, code, etc. Medical networking is one of the newest and most innovative fields today, because it drastically increases the amount, and the speed of medical data being processed and used. The importance of technology in medicine is phenomenal in the past century. Hospitals and clinics use EHR, which is the electronic health record. Things like vaccines, test data, and research can be easily published and shared in between doctors where it can be analyzed much more deeply and faster than it ever has before. For example, many blood tests today are sent electronically instead of by mail, to save days of time. Instead of going to the hospital to get blood drawn and having it analyzed there for AIDS, diabetes, heart disease, or many other diseases, clinics now have machines that will analyze the blood and send a lot of the information to laboratories where they can find further information if needed, and also to record the data for other uses. In the last decade, there has been numerous medical advances that were made possible by the aid of a computer such as minimally invasive robotic surgery and functional brain MRI.
Along with data networking, things like programs and other information can be available in an instant as well. Hospitals nowadays use computers for more than just databases. If you walk around a hospital today, you don’t see PC’s, but you see monitors and nursing stations in each room. These are computers vital to monitoring the patient’s heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, or anything that they need to monitor. It also triggers an alarm when any of those readings go out of the norm. At a hospital, we see computers everywhere from left to right. Nowadays, even the bigger machines are connected to networks and databases. Things like CAT scanners and MRI scanners can diagnose diseases and record the discrepancies and discoveries into a medical database. The networking between computers is vital to not only the hospital, but also to laboratories and laboratory research. Computers and technology is what will advance medical technology to the impossible. Things like the cure for HIV, or the cure for cancer.
